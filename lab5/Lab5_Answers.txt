Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (1 point) To ensure a date appears in the format: MM/DD, what snprintf()
formatting string could be used to ensure dates like 6/9 are generated in a
character buffer as 06/09.

	char buf[17];
	int m = 6; d = 9;
	snprintf(buf, 17, /* you write the format string */, m, d);

"%02d/%02d" 






1. (3 points) Review the conceptual operation of an ADC and use the given
parameters to find the desired value.

  a. Your 8-bit ADC has Hi and Lo reference voltages of 1V and 4V, what digital
  number would result from sampling a 2.0V?
255/3 = 85

  b. Your 5-bit ADC has Hi and Lo reference voltages of 0V and 5V, what input
  voltage would yield a digital number of 12?
(12*5)/31 = 2


  c.  Your 6-bit ADC has a Lo reference voltages of 2V. A voltage is sampled at
  2.4V and the digital result is 26. What was the Hi reference voltage used by
  the ADC?
((0.4*63)/26)+2 = 3V
